- Include quotes from subjects when possible

**Content Types to Include:**
- **Narrative Text**: Describe what you witnessed
- **Images with Captions**: Show the tradition in action
- **Quotes**: Direct quotes from people in your story
- **Cultural Context**: Explain significance of traditions

**Example Section:**
```
TEXT:
B√† NƒÉm, 72, learned this art from her grandmother. Now, she teaches her daughter and granddaughters the precise technique required to create the perfect square cake that symbolizes the earth in Vietnamese cosmology.

IMAGE: [Three generations working together]
CAPTION: Grandmother, mother, and daughter work in harmony, each contributing their knowledge and skills

QUOTE:
"When we make b√°nh ch∆∞ng together, we're not just preparing food. We're keeping our ancestors' spirits alive, sharing their wisdom with the next generation." ‚Äî B√† NƒÉm
```

#### C. Conclusion (1 paragraph)
Reflect on the broader significance of what you documented. How does this tradition connect to Vietnamese cultural identity?

- **Balance**: Mix wide shots, medium shots, and intimate details

#### Language & Tone
- Write in present tense for immediacy

- Keep sentences clear and concise
- Include Vietnamese terms with English explanations
- Respectful and dignified tone

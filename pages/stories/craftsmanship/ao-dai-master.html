                    <p class="story-intro-text">In a narrow alley off Hoi An's bustling Tran Phu Street, a master tailor stitches not just fabric, but cultural memory—one ao dai at a time.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Body Content -->
                <div class="story-body">
                    <p>Ông Minh's hands move with the certainty of five decades' practice. At 68, he can measure a woman's proportions with his eyes alone, knowing exactly where the ao dai's panels should fall to create that quintessentially elegant silhouette—fitted through the torso, flowing at the sides.</p>

                    <p>"The ao dai is not just clothing," he explains, pausing his work to gesture at a rack of silk garments in jewel tones. "It is Vietnamese identity worn on the body. When I create one, I am preserving something older than myself."</p>

                    <p>He learned his craft in the 1970s, during a time when wearing the ao dai carried political weight. After reunification in 1975, the garment fell out of favor—seen by some as too "bourgeois," too connected to the former South Vietnam. But tailors like Ông Minh quietly kept the tradition alive, making ao dai for weddings, Tết celebrations, and the families who refused to let their cultural heritage fade.</p>

                    <p>The ao dai has since experienced a renaissance. Young Vietnamese women wear modernized versions as daily clothing. Designers experiment with contemporary fabrics and cuts while maintaining the garment's essential elegance. Foreign visitors to Hoi An often have ao dai custom-made as souvenirs—though Ông Minh notes, with gentle humor, that tourists and locals request very different styles.</p>

                    <blockquote class="story-quote">
                        <p>"Foreigners want ao dai that fit like their Western clothes—tight, revealing. Vietnamese women know the beauty is in how it *suggests* the body beneath, not reveals it. The art is in the subtlety."</p>

                    </figure>

                    <p>His workshop employs six seamstresses, three of them under 30. Training them properly takes years. "You can learn to sew in weeks," Ông Minh says. "But understanding how silk moves, how to cut for different body types, how to create ao dai that honors both tradition and the woman who wears it—that takes much longer."</p>

                    <p>His youngest apprentice, 24-year-old Thu, has been with him for three years. She initially planned to study business in Ho Chi Minh City but became fascinated by her grandmother's ao dai collection. "My bà ngoại had ao dai from the 1960s—such incredible workmanship," Thu explains. "I wanted to learn how they were made. Ông Minh is one of the last who really knows."</p>

                    </figure>

                    <p>The process of creating a custom ao dai is intimate. Multiple fittings, careful adjustments, conversations about color and fabric and occasion. Ông Minh remembers most of his regular customers—their measurements, their preferences, the events they ordered ao dai for. "I made ao dai for one woman's wedding 30 years ago. Now I make them for her daughter. Soon, perhaps her granddaughter."</p>

                    <p>He worries about the future of true craftsmanship in an age of fast fashion and machine production. But watching Thu work, her concentration absolute as she hand-stitches a panel, he finds reasons for optimism. "The young people who come to learn now—they understand that what we do is important. Not for money. For memory."</p>

                    <p class="story-conclusion">As evening falls over Hoi An, Ông Minh completes his final fitting of the day—a bride-to-be trying on her wedding ao dai for the first time. The young woman's face, reflected in the mirror, radiates joy. In that moment, fifty years of tradition, skill, and cultural preservation come together in flowing white silk, precisely cut, perfectly fitted—a living embodiment of Vietnamese elegance.</p>

**Impact:** Events display correctly on homepage, may not on sub-pages

**Quick Fix:**
Any page that loads events should use:
```javascript
fetch('../data/events.json')  // From pages/
fetch('data/events.json')      // From root
```

### Missing Favicon
**Issue:** Browser looks for favicon.ico
**Status:** Not created yet
